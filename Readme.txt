Hello,
First off, thanks for visiting my profile. My name is Dakota Roberts, and I am in my junior year of college at Athens State University. The lack of projects on my page is because most of my work is private. The projects the professors have assigned me are reused for the next semester of classes, and I don't wish to be the reason they get hit with plagiarism. Some coding projects included making a blackjack program without using arrays or vectors, and another was making a movie seating chart that accounts for social distancing. My projects are a bit bland for this reason, but I think these projects are simple and just provide a learning experience rather than a real-world application.
